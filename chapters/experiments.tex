\Chapter{Experiments}\label{chapter:experiments}

In this chapter, I describe the experimental validation of the proposed novel view synthesis method. The chapter begins by detailing the experimental setup, including data loading, evaluation metrics, and baseline training configurations. Subsequently, a series of targeted experiments are presented, designed to analyze the impact of different architectural components, conditioning strategies and training parameters. Each experiment's rationale, methodology, and results are discussed. The chapter also includes a qualitative analysis of generated images, a comparison with state-of-the-art methods where applicable, and an analysis of the model's inference efficiency.

\section{Experimental Setup}\label{sec:exp_setup}

This section outlines the common foundation for all experiments, including the data loading setup, the metrics for evaluation, and the standard training configuration of the proposed model.

\subsection{Datasets}\label{ssec:exp_datasets}
The experiments leverage two primary datasets, as detailed in Chapter \ref{chapter:data-preparation}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Training Data}: The core training dataset is derived from ObjaverseXL \cite{objaversexl}, consisting of approximately 20,000 processed 3D models. For each model, a set of 6, 8, or 12 views were rendered at $1024 \times 1024$ resolution and subsequently resized to $768 \times 768$ for training. Textual prompts corresponding to these views were generated using the Qwen2.5VL multimodal LLM, as described in Section \ref{ssec:text-generation}.
  \item \textbf{Validation and Test Data}: The Google Scanned Objects (GSO) dataset \cite{gso} serves as the testing set for evaluating generalization capabilities and for quantitative comparisons against state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, a small fraction of the processed ObjaverseXL dataset was reserved as an internal validation set to monitor training progress.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Loading and Preprocessing}\label{ssec:exp_data_loading}
The training and evaluation data, derived from the ObjaverseXL and GSO datasets, are processed and loaded as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Dataset Splitting}: The collection of object files is deterministically split into training, validation, and test sets. This division is based on a specified ratio (e.g., 80\% train, 10\% validation, 10\% test) applied after shuffling the list of all available object archives using a fixed random seed. This ensures reproducibility of the splits across different runs and does not mix up the same object in different splits.

  \item \textbf{View Pair Generation}: For each object within a given split, pairs of source and target view pairs are constructed. They are randomly selected between each other, with a limit of 8 view pairs per object.

  \item \textbf{Individual Item Preprocessing}: When a specific view pair is constructed, the source and target images are loaded in a RGBA format, and then alpha-composited onto a white background before being converted to RGB. Images are resized to the specified $target_size$ (e.g., $768 \times 768$ pixels) using Lanczos resampling. The pixel values of the images are then normalized to the range [-1.0, 1.0] by scaling from [0, 255], since this is an expected format by VAE encoder.
\end{itemize}

This data loading pipeline ensures that the model receives consistently processed and structured input, suitable for training a Latent Diffusion Model.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}\label{ssec:exp_metrics}
To quantitatively test the performance of the novel view synthesis, the following metrics were employed:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)}: Measures pixel-wise reconstruction accuracy. Higher is better.
  \item \textbf{Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM)} \cite{ssim}: Assesses perceptual similarity based on luminance, contrast, and structure. Values range from -1 to 1, with 1 indicating perfect similarity.
  \item \textbf{Perceptual Loss}: Calculates the distance between feature activations in VGG16 model of generated and reference images, aligning better with human perception of image similarity \cite{perceptual_loss}. Lower is better.
  \item \textbf{Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS)} \cite{lpips}: Calculates the distance between deep features of generated and reference images, aligning better with human perception of image similarity. Lower is better.
  \item \textbf{Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)} \cite{fid1, fid2}: Compares the statistical similarity between distributions of generated images and real target views using InceptionV3 embeddings. Lower is better.
  \item \textbf{CLIP Score} \cite{clipscore}: Measures the cosine similarity between CLIP embeddings of the generated image and the target view. Higher is better.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Baseline Training Configuration}\label{ssec:exp_baseline_config}
The proposed model, unless specified differently for a particular experiment, is trained using the following configuration:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Base Model Architecture}: Stable Diffusion 2.1, with the VAE and text encoder frozen. The U-Net is modified with the proposed image cross-attention adapters and FiLM layers for camera conditioning.
  \item \textbf{Trainable Parameters}: Only the newly introduced adapter layers, the $ImageEncoder$'s non-U-Net parts (if any beyond feature extraction), and the $CameraEncoder$ MLP and FiLM generator layers are trained. The original Stable Diffusion U-Net weights (when used for feature extraction in $ImageEncoder$ or as the backbone for the $MultiViewUNet$) remain frozen unless part of a full fine-tuning experiment.
  \item \textbf{Optimizer}: AdamW \cite{adamw}.
  \item \textbf{Learning Rate}: $1 \times 10^{-5}$.
  \item \textbf{Learning Rate Schedule}: Cosine annealing with a warm-up period of 500 steps.
  \item \textbf{Batch Size}: 6 per GPU, with gradient accumulation steps set to 1 (defined to change the effective batch size if needed).
  \item \textbf{Hardware}: 4 x NVIDIA A100 40GB GPUs.
  \item \textbf{Training Duration}: Typically 10 epochs for the 20k ObjaverseXL dataset, or a proportionally scaled number of steps for smaller datasets/experiments.
  \item \textbf{Image Resolution}: Input and output images are $768 \times 768$ pixels.
  \item \textbf{Default Conditioning Strengths}: $img\_ref\_scale$, $cam\_mod\_strength$.
  \item \textbf{Loss Function}: MSE loss with Min-SNR weighting strategy ($\gamma=5.0$).
  \item \textbf{Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) Scale (Inference)}: 1.0.
  \item \textbf{Inference Steps}: 20 steps using a DDPMScheduler.
\end{itemize}

\section{Performed Experiments}\label{sec:exp_analysis}

This section presents a series of experiments designed to dissect the proposed architecture and study the impact of key design choices and training methodologies.

\subsection{E1: Impact of Conditioning Strengths (img-ref-scale and cam-mod-strength)}\label{ssec:exp_conditioning_strengths}

\textbf{Objective}:
To determine the optimal operating range and sensitivity of the model to the $img\_ref\_scale$ (controlling influence of reference image features) and $cam\_mod\_strength$ (controlling influence of camera FiLM modulation) hyperparameters.

\textbf{Methodology}:
A hiperparameter tuning was performed by training separate models with various combinations of conditioning strength parameters. These experiments were conducted on a 5,000-sample subset of the ObjaverseXL dataset. The $img\_ref\_scale$ values tested were \{0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0\} and $cam\_mod\_strength$ values tested were \{0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0\}. Performance during these validation runs was evaluated using PSNR, SSIM, Perceptual Loss, FID, and CLIP score. The training loss was also monitored.

\textbf{Results and Discussion}:
The impact of varying conditioning strengths on different evaluation metrics is presented below. The Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) is a key metric for assessing the quality of generated images.
Figure \ref{fig:exp_cond_metrics_grid} shows the effect of conditioning strengths on Perceptual Loss, SSIM, CLIP score, and FID.

  \caption{E1: Impact of conditioning strengths on various metrics: (a) CLIP Score, (b) SSIM, (c) Perceptual Loss, (d) FID Score.}
  \label{fig:exp_cond_metrics_grid}
\end{figure}

Impact of Camera Modulation Strength:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Low Camera Strength: Consistently, low $cam\_mod\_strength$ values, particularly $0.1$, resulted in markedly inferior performance. These configurations exhibited the highest (worst) FID scores, generally above $170$, and the lowest (worst) CLIP scores, around $0.68-0.69$, as well as the lowest SSIM values, around $0.88$. This indicates that with weak camera conditioning, the model struggles to accurately interpret and apply the target view geometry, leading to poor synthesis quality and geometric inaccuracies.
  \item A $cam\_mod\_strength$ of $0.25$ showed an improvement over $0.1$ but still significantly underperformed compared to stronger camera conditioning.
  \item High Camera Strength: Increasing $cam\_mod\_strength$ to $0.5$, $0.75$, or $1.0$ generally led to substantial improvements across FID, CLIP, and SSIM.
\end{itemize}

Impact of Reference Image Conditioning Strength:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Low Image Reference Strength: An $img\_ref\_scale$ of $0.1$, when paired with low to moderate $cam\_mod\_strength$, generally resulted in poorer FID, CLIP, and SSIM scores compared to higher $img\_ref\_scale$ values. This suggests that some degree of visual information from the source view is beneficial for guiding the synthesis process.
  \item Moderate Image Reference Strength: An $img\_ref\_scale$ of $0.25$ emerged as a particularly effective value, especially for optimizing FID. When combined with adequate $cam\_mod\_strength$ ($0.5$ or higher), configurations such as $cam=0.75 img=0.25$, $cam=1.0 img=0.25$ and $cam=0.5 img=0.25$ consistently achieved among the lowest FID scores (around 50-60). These combinations also yielded strong CLIP scores (approx. 0.76-0.78) and SSIM values (approx. 0.91-0.925).
  \item High Image Reference Strength: An $img\_ref\_scale$ of 1.0, when paired with high $cam\_mod\_strength$, also demonstrated top-tier performance, particularly excelling in CLIP score (reaching up to $\approx 0.79$) and SSIM (reaching up to $\approx 0.93$). However, these configurations sometimes resulted in slightly higher (worse) FID scores compared to their $img\_ref\_scale=0.25$ counterparts with similar high $cam\_mod\_strength$. This might suggest that while a strong reference image signal can enhance perceptual similarity and structural details (benefiting CLIP and SSIM), it might slightly constrain the model's ability to generate the most statistically faithful novel view if it adheres too closely to the source image features.
\end{itemize}

This hyperparameter sweep demonstrates that the model is sensitive to both $cam\_mod\_strength$ and $img\_ref\_scale$. For the most robust novel view synthesis, a $cam\_mod\_strength$ of at least $0.5$ is recommended, with $0.75$ or $1.0$ often yielding the best results. For $img\_ref\_scale$, a value of $0.25$ provides an excellent balance, particularly for FID, while $img\_ref\_scale=1.0$ can also be highly effective, especially for maximizing CLIP and SSIM scores when paired with strong camera conditioning.
In the future experiments, the parameters were set to $img\_ref\_scale=0.75$ and $cam\_mod\_strength=1.0$.

\subsection{E2: Training Strategy: Adapters vs. Full Fine-tuning}\label{ssec:exp_adapters_vs_full_finetuning}
\textbf{Objective}:
To compare the performance, training efficiency (time and computational resources), and parameter efficiency of the proposed adapter-based training approach against full fine-tuning of the U-Net. This addresses the "Training adapter only vs full fine-tuning" point.

\textbf{Methodology}:
Two main training strategies were compared. The first approach involved training only the lightweight adapter modules and camera conditioning encoder (adapter only training), keeping the backbone Stable Diffusion U-Net frozen. For a direct comparison on a smaller scale, this was performed on a 5,000-sample subset of ObjaverseXL for 10 epochs.

The second approach involved fine-tuning the entire U-Net along with the adapters and conditioning encoders (full U-Net fine-tuning). This was performed on a 5,000-sample subset of ObjaverseXL for 10 epochs for comparison with the adapter-only training on the same dataset size.

  \end{subfigure}

  \caption{E2: Training adapters only vs. full fine-tuning of U-Net on various metrics: (a) CLIP Score, (b) SSIM, (c) Perceptual Loss, (d) FID Score.}
  \label{fig:exp_adap_vs_full_metrics_grid}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Results and Discussion}:
Training the adapter only was possible with batch size of 6 (per GPU) and full fine-tuning was possible with batch size of 2 (per GPU) with gradient accumulation steps set to 3 to match the effective batch size between the two approaches.

Out of the $2.9B$ parameters of the full model (U-Net + VAE + Text Encoder + Adapters), $585M$ are trainable in the adapter only method and $2.3B$ are trainable in the full fine-tuning method.

The adapter only method, trained for 10 epochs took 9 hours on 4 x NVIDIA A100 40GB GPUs. The full fine-tuning method, trained for 10 epochs took 35 hours on the same hardware. This is a significant difference in training time, but the adapter only method is still able to achieve a comparable performance to the full fine-tuning method.

The quantitative results on auxiliary metrics are shown in Figure \ref{fig:exp_adap_vs_full_metrics_grid}. The full fine-tuning method is able to achieve a slightly better performance on the Perceptual Loss metric, but the adapter only method achieves a comparable performance based on the SSIM, CLIP Score, and FID metrics.

\subsection{E3: Camera Encoder Architecture Details}\label{ssec:exp_camera_encoder_depth}
\textbf{Objective}:
To investigate the impact of the $CameraEncoder$'s architectural design on novel view synthesis performance. Specifically, this experiment explores two main factors: (1) the depth of the Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) used to process relative rotation and translation camera parameters, and (2) the dimensionality of the internal hidden representations and the final camera embedding used for FiLM modulation.

\textbf{Methodology}:
The $CameraEncoder$ module computes a relative transformation (rotation matrix $R$ and translation vector $T$) between source and target camera poses. The translation vector undergoes positional encoding. Both $R$ (flattened) and the positionally encoded $T$ are then processed by separate MLP streams before their outputs are concatenated and passed through a final projection MLP to produce the camera embedding.
Four configurations of the $CameraEncoder$ were evaluated, varying MLP depth and embedding dimensionality:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Shallower MLPs, Lower Dimensionality}: Rotation and translation encoder MLPs each consist of two linear transformation stages. The internal hidden dimension within these MLPs is 512, and the final camera embedding dimension is 1024.
  \item \textbf{Shallower MLPs, Higher Dimensionality}: Rotation and translation encoder MLPs each consist of two linear transformation stages. The internal hidden dimension is 1024, and the final camera embedding dimension is 2048.
  \item \textbf{Deeper MLPs, Lower Dimensionality}: Rotation and translation encoder MLPs each consist of three linear transformation stages. The internal hidden dimension is 512, and the final camera embedding dimension is 1024.
  \item \textbf{Deeper MLPs, Higher Dimensionality}: Rotation and translation encoder MLPs each consist of three linear transformation stages. The internal hidden dimension is 1024, and the final camera embedding dimension is 2048.
\end{itemize}
All four model variants, differing only in their $CameraEncoder$ configuration as described, were trained using the adapter-only approach on a 5,000-sample subset of the ObjaverseXL dataset for 10 epochs.

  \end{subfigure}

  \caption{E3: Impact of camera encoder depth on various metrics: (a) CLIP Score, (b) SSIM, (c) Perceptual Loss, (d) FID Score.}
  \label{fig:exp_cam_depth_metrics_grid}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Results and Discussion}:
The quantitative results demonstrate consistent performance across all four $/text{CameraEncoder}$ architectural variants, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:exp_cam_depth_metrics_grid}. All configurations converge to similar final values: CLIP scores of $\approx 0.78-0.79$, SSIM values of $\approx 0.92-0.93$, FID scores of $\approx 103-106$, and perceptual loss of $\approx 3.6-3.7$. This consistency suggests that architectural complexity has minimal impact on camera parameter encoding effectiveness.

Detailed analysis reveals:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{MLP Depth}: Deeper 3-layer configurations (3L-512, 3L-1024) show no substantial advantages over 2-layer counterparts (2L-512, 2L-1024). Performance differences remain within typical training variance, indicating that additional depth does not enhance camera transformation encoding.
  \item \textbf{Embedding Dimensionality}: Increasing hidden dimensions from 512 to 1024 and final embeddings from 1024 to 2048 produces negligible performance improvements. Lower-dimensional representations appear sufficient for capturing necessary geometric relationships.
  \item \textbf{Training Dynamics}: All variants exhibit similar convergence patterns and stable validation metrics, demonstrating that FiLM-based conditioning is robust to moderate architectural variations.
  \item \textbf{Marginal Differences}: 3L-512 achieves slightly better FID performance.
\end{itemize}

These findings indicate that the camera encoding bottleneck lies in the fundamental challenge of mapping geometric transformations to effective feature modulations, rather than architectural complexity. The baseline 2L-512 configuration provides optimal efficiency while maintaining competitive performance, validating its use in subsequent experiments.

\subsection{E4: Impact of Training Data Scale}\label{ssec:exp_data_scale}
\textbf{Objective}: To investigate how the size of the training dataset (number of unique 3D objects from ObjaverseXL) influences the model\'s performance, particularly its generalization ability to unseen objects (GSO dataset) and overall robustness. This is especially relevant for addressing the "Adaptation to unseen objects" limitation of current state-of-the-art methods.

\textbf{Methodology}:
The proposed model, using the adapter-only training approach and consistent conditioning strengths where possible, was evaluated on increasingly larger subsets of the processed ObjaverseXL dataset:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{1,000 samples} for 10 epochs.
  \item \textbf{5,000 samples} for 10 epochs.
  \item \textbf{20,000 samples} for 10 epochs.
\end{itemize}
All models were trained for a comparable number of effective updates relative to their dataset size where possible (e.g., by adjusting epoch counts or comparing at similar total iterations/epochs across all scales). Performance was evaluated on the GSO test set using all key metrics.

  \label{fig:exp_data_scale_metrics_grid}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Results and Discussion}: The results demonstrate a clear positive correlation between training data scale and model performance across all evaluation metrics, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:exp_data_scale_metrics_grid}.

\textbf{Performance Scaling with Data Size}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{1,000 Samples}: The smallest dataset configuration achieved the lowest performance across all metrics. CLIP scores plateaued around $0.77$, SSIM values reached approximately $0.91$, FID scores remained elevated at around $70$, and perceptual loss fluctuated around $4.5$. This indicates that insufficient training data limits the model's ability to learn robust visual-geometric relationships necessary for high-quality novel view synthesis.

  \item \textbf{5,000 Samples}: Scaling up to 5,000 samples showed notable improvements across all metrics. CLIP scores improved to approximately $0.78-0.79$, SSIM values increased to around $0.92$, FID scores decreased to approximately $60$, and perceptual loss reduced to around $4.2$. This demonstrates that increased data diversity enhances the model's understanding of 3D object appearance and geometry.

  \item \textbf{20,000 Samples}: The largest dataset configuration achieved the best performance across all metrics. CLIP scores reached the highest values of approximately $0.79$, SSIM peaked at around $0.93$, FID achieved the lowest scores of approximately $45$, and perceptual loss reached the minimum values of around $3.7$. This configuration also demonstrated the most stable training dynamics, as evidenced by the smoother convergence curves.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Training Dynamics and Convergence}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Convergence Speed}: Larger datasets exhibited faster and more stable convergence patterns. The 20,000-sample configuration showed the smoothest training loss curves with minimal fluctuations, while smaller datasets displayed more erratic training dynamics.
  \item \textbf{Generalization}: The performance improvements observed with larger training sets directly translated to better generalization on the GSO test set, indicating that increased data diversity helps the model adapt to unseen object geometries and appearances.
  \item \textbf{Training Stability}: Models trained on larger datasets showed reduced variance in validation metrics across different training runs, suggesting improved robustness to initialization and sampling variations.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Data Scaling Implications}:
The consistent improvement across all metrics with increased training data size validates several key hypotheses:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Diversity Benefits}: Larger datasets provide greater diversity in object shapes, textures, and lighting conditions, enabling the model to learn more generalizable representations for novel view synthesis.
  \item \textbf{Geometric Understanding}: The improvement in SSIM and perceptual metrics indicates that more training data enhances the model's ability to preserve structural details and geometric consistency across viewpoints.
  \item \textbf{Distribution Matching}: The reduction in FID scores with larger datasets suggests that the model better captures the statistical properties of real image distributions when provided with more diverse training examples.
\end{itemize}

These findings strongly support the importance of large-scale training data for robust diffusion-based novel view synthesis and suggest that further scaling beyond 20,000 samples could yield additional performance improvements. However, even the largest configuration tested (20,000 samples) remains substantially smaller than state-of-the-art methods like Zero123++, which utilized $800K+$ 3D models - indicating that the observed performance limitations may be fundamentally constrained by data scale rather than architectural choices. The 20,000-sample configuration was selected as the baseline for subsequent experiments and final model evaluation within the available computational constraints.

\section{Comparison with State-of-the-Art Methods on GSO Dataset}\label{sec:exp_gso_quantitative_sota}

This section presents the quantitative performance of the final proposed model on the Google Scanned Objects (GSO) dataset and compares it against relevant state-of-the-art methods.

\subsection{Performance of the Proposed Method}\label{ssec:exp_gso_our_model}
To comprehensively evaluate the proposed novel view synthesis method, three model configurations representing different training data scales were assessed on the GSO dataset. These configurations were selected to demonstrate the impact of training data size on generalization performance:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Configuration 1}: Trained on 1,000 ObjaverseXL samples for 10 epochs.
  \item \textbf{Configuration 2}: Trained on 5,000 ObjaverseXL samples for 10 epochs.
  \item \textbf{Configuration 3}: Trained on 20,000 ObjaverseXL samples for 10 epochs.
\end{itemize}

All models were trained using the adapter-based approach with optimal hyperparameters ($img\_ref\_scale=1.0$ and $cam\_mod\_strength=1.0$) identified in previous experiments.

The evaluation protocol followed a standardized procedure where each model received a source view and the corresponding camera transformation parameters to synthesize a target novel view. The generated images were then quantitatively compared against ground truth target views using the established evaluation metrics. All assessments were conducted on a held-out test set comprising 100 carefully selected samples from the GSO dataset, ensuring no overlap with training data and providing a robust benchmark for cross-dataset generalization capabilities.

\subsection{Comparison with State-of-the-Art Methods}\label{ssec:exp_sota_comparison}
The performance of the proposed method is compared against two contemporary novel view synthesis techniques: Zero123++ and MVAdapter. The results, evaluated on 100 samples from the GSO dataset with aligned camera angles and consistent conditioning (reference image and text prompt), are presented in Table \ref{tab:sota_comparison_gso}. The comparison reveals significant performance gaps, with the proposed method underperforming established approaches across key metrics. Notably, these performance differences must be contextualized by the substantial disparity in training data scale: Zero123++ was trained on 800K+ Objaverse models with approximately 10M rendered images, while the proposed method used only 20,000 models - representing a 40$\times$ difference in 3D model diversity and likely 100$\times$ difference in training images. This fundamental difference in data scale significantly impacts generalization capabilities to unseen objects.

\subsection{Inference Time Analysis}\label{ssec:exp_inference_time}
\textbf{Objective}: To quantify the computational efficiency of the proposed model during the inference phase (novel view generation).

\textbf{Methodology}:
The average inference time was measured for generating a single novel view at the target resolution of $768 \times 768$ pixels.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Hardware Used}: Single NVIDIA A100 40GB GPU.
  \item \textbf{Model Configuration}: The best performing adapter-based model (trained on 20,000 ObjaverseXL samples).
  \item \textbf{Inference Steps}: 20 diffusion steps.
  \item \textbf{Batch Size for Inference}: 1 (generating one view at a time).
\end{itemize}

The results will be compared to the inference time of other state-of-the-art methods Zero123++ \cite{zero1to3} and MVAdapter \cite{mvadapter} (with their default settings).

  \caption{Inference time comparison with state-of-the-art methods.}
  \label{tab:inference_time_comparison}
  \begin{tabular}{lccc}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Method} & \textbf{Inference Time (seconds)} $\downarrow$ \\
    \midrule
    Zero123++ \cite{zero1to3} & 6.51 \\
    MVAdapter \cite{mvadapter} & 19.42 \\
    Proposed Method & 16.04 \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Results and Discussion}: The proposed adapter-based model achieves an average inference time of 16.04 seconds per $768 \times 768$ image on an NVIDIA A100 GPU, using 20 denoising steps. This suggests that the proposed model is able to generate novel views in comparable time to the MVAdapter method. The Zero123++ method is still significantly faster, with an average inference time of 6.51 seconds.

\section{Qualitative Results}\label{sec:exp_qualitative_results}

This section presents visual examples of novel view synthesis results generated by the proposed method on the GSO test dataset. Each comparison image shows three views arranged side by side: the source (reference) image on the left, the ground truth target view in the middle, and the synthesized novel view generated by the proposed method on the right. The selected samples demonstrate the method's performance across various object categories, geometric complexities, and viewpoint transformations present in the GSO dataset.

\newpage
The qualitative results reveal several consistent patterns in the model's performance limitations. While the proposed method demonstrates a fundamental understanding of 3D geometry and can generate plausible novel views that preserve basic object structure and pose, the generated images consistently suffer from reduced visual fidelity compared to ground truth targets. Common issues include: (1) texture degradation and loss of fine surface details, (2) color desaturation and shifts that reduce material realism, (3) overall blurriness that diminishes image sharpness, and (4) simplified representations of complex geometric features.

The model shows particular strength in maintaining overall object proportions and spatial relationships, indicating successful camera conditioning, but struggles with high-frequency details and photorealistic texture synthesis. These visual limitations align closely with the quantitative metrics, where lower PSNR and SSIM scores reflect the reduced pixel-level accuracy and structural preservation, while higher perceptual loss values indicate the model's difficulty in capturing perceptually important visual features that distinguish high-quality novel view synthesis.

\section{Chapter Summary}\label{sec:exp_summary}
This chapter detailed the comprehensive experimental evaluation of the proposed multi-view novel view synthesis method. The experimental setup, including datasets (ObjaverseXL for training, GSO for testing) and evaluation metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, FID, CLIP score), was established.

Key findings from the experiments include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Optimal Conditioning Strengths}: The investigation into $img\_ref\_scale$ and $cam\_mod\_strength$ (Section \ref{ssec:exp_conditioning_strengths}) identified optimal ranges for these hyperparameters, demonstrating a balance is needed to effectively incorporate conditioning signals without introducing artifacts. The combination of $img\_ref\_scale=1.0$ and $cam\_mod\_strength=1.0$ was found to be effective.
  \item \textbf{Efficiency of Adapter-Based Training}: The comparison between adapter-only training and full U-Net fine-tuning (Section \ref{ssec:exp_adapters_vs_full_finetuning}) highlighted the significant advantages of the adapter approach in terms of parameter efficiency and training resource reduction, while achieving competitive performance.
  \item \textbf{Camera Encoder Design}: Experiments with the $CameraEncoder$ architecture (Section \ref{ssec:exp_camera_encoder_depth}) suggested that the baseline moderately complex encoder offered a good balance of performance and efficiency.
  \item \textbf{Impact of Data Scale}: Increasing the training data size (Section \ref{ssec:exp_data_scale}) generally led to improved performance and generalization on the GSO dataset, underscoring the importance of large-scale diverse data for training robust NVS models.
\end{itemize}

Quantitative evaluation on the GSO dataset (Section \ref{sec:exp_gso_quantitative_sota}) revealed substantial performance gaps compared to SOTA approaches like Zero123++ and MVAdapter. The proposed method achieves PSNR scores approximately $30\%$ lower than Zero123++, indicating significant room for improvement in reconstruction quality. The FID score of 45, while improved from smaller training datasets, remains considerably high for image generation tasks and suggests that further training is needed to improve the quality of the generated images.

While the experiments provide insights into architectural design choices and training strategies, the results highlight the challenges in achieving competitive performance for diffusion-based novel view synthesis within resource constraints. The significant underperformance compared to established methods can be largely attributed to the substantial difference in training data scale - Zero123++ leveraged $40\times$ more 3D models and approximately $100\times$ more training images than the proposed method. This disparity fundamentally limits the model's ability to generalize across diverse object types and geometric configurations, as evidenced by the performance gaps on the GSO dataset. Future work must address these limitations either through access to larger-scale training data, more sophisticated architectures that can better leverage limited data, or hybrid approaches that combine the demonstrated efficiency benefits with improved synthesis capabilities.
