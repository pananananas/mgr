\Chapter{Related Work}\label{chapter:related}

In this chapter, we review existing approaches to multi-view image generation and novel view synthesis. We first discuss traditional SLAM-based methods of novel view synthesis (Section X.1), followed by prompt-image based generative models for view synthesis (Section X.2), with particular emphasis on adapter based methods to fine-tune diffusion models to generate views from a single image (Section X.3). Finally, we analyze the limitations of current methods and identify research gaps that our work aims to address (Section X.4).

The general idea of novel view synthesis is to generate a new view of a scene from a set of multi-view images. 
The main challenge is to handle the scene's 3D structure and the camera's motion.
