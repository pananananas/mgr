Create an image of a miniature lighthouse with a rustic vintage design. The base is made of dark wood with a polished finish, supporting a cylindrical tower made from a lighter material. The upper part features a lantern-like structure painted in a light color, adorned with small decorative elements like round windows or panels. The top is capped with a small, pointed roof made from the same light-colored material, slightly tilted.
