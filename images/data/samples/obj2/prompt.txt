Create a detailed 3D model of a rustic cabin with a rectangular shape and slightly rounded corners. The cabin should have a warm, golden hue roof covered with shingles, wooden walls painted in a light color, small rectangular windows and door, and a raised foundation on stilts. The base should be a flat, green surface representing grass or another natural material. The overall aesthetic should be charming and rustic, with attention to detail in the textures and colors of the materials used.
