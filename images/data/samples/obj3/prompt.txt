Create an image of a modern kitchen appliance, specifically a gas cooktop with an integrated oven. The design is sleek and contemporary, featuring a combination of materials that give it a sophisticated look. The cooktop section is made from a light-colored material, likely stainless steel or a similar metal, which reflects light and gives it a polished appearance. The burners are evenly spaced and appear to be made of a durable material, possibly ceramic or porcelain, which is typical for gas cooktops due to its resistance to heat and easy cleaning. Above the cooktop, there is a hood that is also made from the same light-colored material, maintaining the cohesive design. The hood extends outward, suggesting it is designed to cover the entire cooktop area, providing ventilation for the cooking process. The edges of the hood are rounded, adding to the modern aesthetic. The overall shape of the appliance is rectangular, with rounded edges that add to its modern and clean appearance. The color scheme is primarily metallic silver and black, with the black elements providing contrast against the silver surfaces.
